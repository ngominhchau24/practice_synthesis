# Lab 3: BDD-based Netlist Generation
# Optional dependencies for optimized BDD operations

# Recommended BDD library (optional but recommended for production):
# dd>=0.5.6          # Optimized BDD with automatic variable reordering
# OR
# pyeda>=0.28.0      # Alternative BDD library with Espresso integration

# Note: The current implementation uses a simplified built-in BDD
# to avoid dependencies. For better optimization and larger circuits,
# install one of the above packages.

# Installation:
#   pip install dd  # Recommended
#   OR
#   pip install pyeda

# No dependencies required for basic functionality
